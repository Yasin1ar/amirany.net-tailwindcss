# My personal webpage 

I coded only with HTML and CSS, I used Tailwind as the css framwork, it made development much easy and offers me a lot of tools to customize my page which I coudn't do otherwise,
and I deployed my static webpage on Github page, it's easy to deploy, secure, and the best of all, it's free! simply the best option to deploy static sites, I encourage everyone to do that.
